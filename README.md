# Glove
IT-Team School Project : developpement of a Sign Language Translator Glove (here is the mobile application).
For the moment, we are just focusing on the alphabet letter translation.

The glove sends a signal to an aduino bluetooth card which translates it into a letter. Then, it sends this letter to the mobile application which is going to display and pronouce it. 

This mobile application can : 
- Verify if the Bluetooth is Enable or not.
- Ask the user if he gives the authorization of setting the Bluetooth enable
- Set the Bluetooth Enable.
- Display the list of the appaired devices.
- Do the Client connection between an Arduino and the Mobile Phone (the mobile phone cans ask the arduino to connect but the Arduino can ask the mobile Phone to connect
- Display the letter.

Not tested : 
- pronounce the letter
